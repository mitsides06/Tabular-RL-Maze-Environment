## Project Description 
This project focuses on implementing and analyzing various reinforcement learning algorithms. The key algorithms explored are Value Iteration, Monte Carlo Control, and Q-learning. It includes analysis on the performance and behaviour of these algorithms under different conditions.

## Contents
- "main.py" : Contains the implementation of the reinforcement learning algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and code for generating visualizations.
- "report.pdf" : Discusses the theoretical background, implementation details, and findings of the project, enhanced with visualizations.

## Key Features
- **Value Iteration Algorithm:** Implementation and analysis of convergence speed and policy optimality.
- **Monte Carlo Control with ε-greedy Policy:** On-policy first-visit MC control algorithm with an exploration parameter.
- **Q-Learning:** Off-policy algorithm with ε-greedy policy for exploration and exploitation.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Exploration parameter and learning rate adjustments to optimize algorithm performance.
- **Matplotlib Visualizations:** Graphical analysis of exploration parameter and learning rate, and visualizations of algorithm perfromance and evalutions.
